/**
 * Compute the padding suffix given the message length.
 *
 * Given a pointer into DMEM and the message length in bytes, appends padding
 * to the message as needed.
 *
 * The padding process results in the bytes:
 *   msg || 0x80 || <zeroes> || len(msg)
 *
 * ...where len(msg) is a 128-bit big-endian encoding of the message length in
 * bits, and the total padded message length is a multiple of 1024 bits.
 *
 * The length of the message itself is at most (2^125 - 1) bytes, because its
 * bit-length must fit in 128 bits. However, it is provided as 256 bits to
 * support wide-word reasoning, and the pointer must be 32-bit aligned.
 *
 * The caller must ensure that the start of the message block is 32-bit aligned
 * (even if that means dptr_pad is not) and that there is enough space in DMEM
 * at the end of the message for the padding.  Precisely, the padded length
 * will be the smallest multiple of 1024 bits (128 bytes) that will fit the
 * message plus 17 bytes.
 *
 * Note that 144 bytes after the message is always enough; this is the maximum
 * padding length.
 *
 * This routine runs in constant time relative to message content but variable
 * time relative to message length.
 *
 * @param[in]  x10: dptr_pad, pointer to end of message in DMEM
 * @param[in]  x11: dptr_len, pointer to message length in bytes (256 bits)
 * @param[in]  w31: all-zero
 * @param[out] x21: dptr_end, pointer to the end of the padding
 * @param[out] dmem[dptr_pad..dptr_end]: message padding
 *
